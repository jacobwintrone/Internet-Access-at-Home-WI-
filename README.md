# Internet-Access-at-Home-WI-

Project Results: The Messy Data csv was cleaned and aggregated with multiple other tables. 

Background: The Internet Access at Home survey was sent to Wisconsin school districts to determine how many of their students have reliable internet access at home. 

Goals: To determine how factors like population, locale (city vs. town vs. rural), and income relate to internet access.

Gathering and Aggregating Data: I downloaded the Messy Data csv, and data on population, locale, and income by Wisconsin county. I imported multiple tables into the same Excel workbook. I used VLOOKUP to combine all relevant variables into a single Excel sheet. I filtered out and fixed #N/A errors caused by inconsistencies among tables. 

Data Cleaning: The Student Internet Access data was very messy, so I completed a data cleaning checklist: 
Creating descriptive but simple column names, rearranging the columns' order to match the survey, adding survey questions to provide context, deleting unnecessary columns, changing data types (the percentage columns were in number format), removing duplicates, and trimming cells. 

An original version of the data was saved, and all changes were documented in comments. The data cleaning checklist above is a summary of those comments. 

Unfortunately, this data was not complete enough to draw any meaningful conclusions from analysis.
