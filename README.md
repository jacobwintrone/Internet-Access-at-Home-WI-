# Internet-Access-at-Home-WI-

Each year, the Wisconsin Department of Instruction (DPI) sends out the "Internet Access at Home" Survey to 
determine how many of their students have reliable access at home. In this project, I clean and analyze that data. 

Section 1: Data Cleaning and Exploration (Excel)
First, I downloaded the Student Internet Access Messy Data from the DPI's open data portal. 
This dataset was very raw, so I went through a complete data cleaning checklist:


Creating descriptive column names
Rearranging the columns' order to match the survey
Adding the survey questions to the Excel sheet to give context to the column names
Deleting unnecessary columns
Changing data types (the percentage columns were in number format)
Removing duplicates
Trimming cells

After cleaning the data, I calculated a few descriptive statistics across the state of Wisconsin, as well as a few simple visualizations to explore the data.
